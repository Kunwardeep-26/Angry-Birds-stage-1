# Angry Birds stage 1 
Design the different classes corresponding to the different game objects in the game - the pig objects, the box objects, the logs, the ground and the bird.
Create the different objects using the above classes and stack them on the screen.
Make the bird object move with the mouse so that it can interact with other objects.
